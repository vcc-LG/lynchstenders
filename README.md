Pull out text from an Eastenders script and overlay on screens from Lynch films

## Why?

I hadn't watched Eastenders in at least 20 years and watched an episode. The stilted rhythm and primarily expository nature of its dialogue reminded me of dialogue from a Lynch movie. So I wrote this to see how the two media felt next to each other.

## How does it work?

1. I got a recent Eastenders script from the internet as a PDF from which I extracted text
2. I parsed out spoken dialogue from the script text
3. I took screens at fixed intervals from the Lynch video file
4. I randomly paired up dialogue with images, including randomly positioning the text box
5. I post the image to Twitter, with an accompanying status message which is taken from OCR done on the image.

## Does it work?

I think it works quite well
