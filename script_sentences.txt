Looks like someone could do with a fry up.
Haven’t got time.
Well, don’t you want to wait for the post - ‘see how many you get?
I couldn’t care less.
So you .. won’t be wanting this then?
Secret admirer?
More like some saddo stalker.
To mark the occasion?
Careful, son, you might take off there.
Who else?
What is it - brandy?
Aftershave.
Gotta be a year’s supply there.
And what does your card say?
She’s.
Well .. at least someone’s made an effort.
So you think Stella deserved that yesterday, do you?
Go on then.
One for you ..
That’s really nice, Abi.
Must’ve taken ages.
I just wanted you both to have one.
They’re not interested in Valentine’s Day.
Your Dad isn’t.
It’s still a special day, so you have to do something if you love someone.
How’s that?
Go on, Cupid, you’ll be late for school.
I said I’d take you out at the weekend, didn’t I?
But not tonight.
Tanya, why d’you think I hate Valentine’s night?
You don’t like being told we need counselling either.
Can we talk about this later?
You said you’d do anything to make me happy.
And I meant it.
Hello?
You want this one?
No, not the Armadillo, she only drinks sweet.
And she really thinks you forgot?
‘Don’t suspect a thing.
You’re .. not gonna try and cook?
I might not be Gordon Ramsay but I can stick a chicken in the oven.
Hope she appreciates it.
She will.
Looks like Dot’s in for a special treat tonight.
Maybe she’s not the only one.
You don’t say.
‘If’ you can manage to get rid of Bert and Jay for the evening.
Oh come on, Mum ..
I just told you, didn’t I?
But I need someone to practice on.
I wouldn’t say no to a free makeover.
There you go - one guinea pig.
Only I can’t get away from the bookies today.
Come on - it’ll cheer you up.
I don’t need ‘cheering up’.
Well maybe I do.
Now that is sad.
Alright.
Mission accomplished.
I’ll get her there, don’t worry.
I know it’s the thought that counts but.
I should’ve sorted this out yesterday.
I thought you did; weren’t you going off to get her present?
And now?
Now she’s turning up anyway.
Well don’t sound too excited.
Maybe I’m not.
Bert ..
I got a good mind to complain ..
Well it is .. 
St Muggin’s Day.
Some people happen to enjoy it.
Yeah, you’re right.
Actually she’s .. planning more on us staying at home.
Even better.
So .. maybe you don’t like Valentine’s Day either.
It’s not the day it’s .. 
What d’you ..  BRADLEY:  Lydia’s just too full on - never stops, like everything’s one big campaign.
I thought you wanted a woman who knows where she’s going.
Well maybe I don’t.
You.
No.  Well yeah we.
Maybe that makes two of you.
So I enjoyed it.
Then maybe you’re right; maybe Lydia’s not the right girl for you.
But ..
The grass is always greener, Bradley.
But ..
‘You forgotten all the grief you got with Stacey?
No but ... maybe that wasn’t all her fault.
You’re feeling guilty.
Maybe.
Well we’ve .. all got stuff to feel guilty about, son.
I know but ... 
On Valentine’s Day?
Yesterday you were telling me it’s all a load of rubbish ..
Well I’m not your girlfriend, am I?
Yeah.
You know I am, son.
Oh come on, Preeti, please?
I’m sorry, Tanya, if it was any other night?
So what’re you doing instead?
Sorry.
‘Course I’d have been happy with just an anniversary card, but no chance of that.
Not yet but ..
Ah there he is.
Sorry I.
One surprise after another, eh?
‘Wish I had.
Well, don’t just stand there - Lydia hasn’t got all day.
Just a couple of hours for lunch.
Right well I’ll .. go and get changed.
And don’t forget her card.
I’m just going out to get a few things for tonight.
Yolande?
You haven’t told Bert, have you.
I tried but .. you know what he’s like.
I know exactly what he’s like - so you’d better find him and make sure he listens this time.
You’re not wearing it, are you?
Off out?
Valentine’s lunch.
Nice one.
We.
A ‘few’?
Don’t ask - he probably lost count.
Sorry?
The lack of consideration.
Preeti sent me up.
Take a seat.
Kevin the romantic sort, is he?
I’m sorry?
I heard he’s away on business but I bet he still sent you a card?
Dot was just saying it’s her anniversary today.
Congratulations.
That’s more than I got from Jim.
Look Dot, I’ve really got to ..  DOT:  What about you and Max?
Actually I was going to take him.
Consider one found.
‘Reckon that’ll do me tonight.
That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.
Eh? PATRICK: With Jay.
Don’t tell me - ‘quality time’?
I’m sure you can occupy yourselves somehow.
I got a card this morning.
I don’t send Valentine’s cards.
Not even to Tanya?
That’s between me and her.
So the answer’s no.
I’m .. only asking cos if you didn’t send it, someone else did?
Why should it?
You tell me.
I couldn’t care less who sent your card.
All you had to say was ‘no’.
Would you .. mind filling my glass?
Sorry.
Happy Valentine’s day.
No, that was just Stacey, she’s not one for holding her drink.
I remember.
Excuse me?
You and me’re gonna have a little chat.
Nice one.
From Abi.
So she’s okay now.
Yeah, she’s fine.
Maybe.
Playing you up, is he?
So?
So kids’re clever - they run rings round you if they see you’re laying down the law and feeling guilty at the same time.
So.
I don’t know.
I’m sorry, Bradley.
It’s alright.
Well .. maybe we can make up for lost time soon?
I’m .. not sure.
You’re not busy, are you?
No but ..
“But” what?
Well we.
Bradley?
We saw each other yesterday .. we’re having lunch today ..
We’re spending too much time together, is that what you’re saying?
It.
So you can go to the Vic in the evening?
Look, this has got nothing to do with Stacey.
I didn’t think it had.
.... she’s hardly your dream girl, is she?
I’m sorry.
What?
Look, I like you, Lydia, I really do ..  LYDIA:  Don’t tell me ..
It’s not you, it’s me ..
Spot on.
I’m .. just not ready for another relationship.
And it’s taken you until now to realise that, has it?
This really is to do with Stacey ..
It’s complicated ..
Is it?
I’m sorry.
Don’t be.
Yolande ..?
Coming.
Don’t worry about Bert and Jay.
Hungry?
Ravenous.
So if we can’t go back, what’re we meant to do?
We .. ’could’ kill a few hours at the flicks.
There’s only some love film on.
How about some ten-pin bowling?
You?
I’ll have you know, when I was your age, my nickname was Lucky Strike.
Whatever.
Well don’t go doing me no favours, lad.
Plenty I could be doing.
Fine.
Stace?
If you’re after a slice, I’m saving it ‘til I get home.
You’re .. not doing anything tonight then?
Actually I got a date ... 
Where’s Lydia?
Oh she’s .. gone.
‘Didn’t drop you in it earlier, did I?
Course not.
Good.
‘Didn’t’ what?
Nothing.
Dorothy?
What’s all ..   JIM:  You didn’t really think I forgot, did you?
Jim I..
Grandma Dot?
You what?
Oh great.
Cool.
It’s the thought that counts.
What’re you watching?
Gran’ll look after you tonight, alright?
Where’re you going?
To meet Stella.
Right, what’ll it be?
Just a beer, please.
Oh come on, I’m pushing the boat out here.
I’m on my own, aren’t I?
And I don’t know why - good looking boy like you.
Just serve ‘em up, Shirley - I’ll keep you company, son.
So who’s up for a drink at the Vic?
Not me - I’ve got a few more things to do here.
Chelsea?
Yeah I’ll come.
I’m going home.
Mum ...
So that’s what all this was about, was it?
And I thought you deserved a Valentine’s treat.
Well.
Come on, Charlie, it’ll be last orders at this rate!
I’m looking for my glasses.
No tempting you out then?
I’m fine.
Sitting here thinking about ‘you ‘know who?
‘Remembered I saw him this morning.
Who?
I still can’t find ‘em ..
Bradley, that’s who.
‘Think’ of what?
You’re wrong, Nan.
Girlfriend or no girlfriend, it was him who sent that card.
Actually .. it was me.
You did that alright.
It was just meant to be a bit of fun but .. 
‘Course I didn’t.
How’re they going down?
Well I’m a real ale man myself, but as far as poncy Southern cocktails go, they certainly pack a punch.
Suit yourself.
Ah Pat .. 
What - when it’s dark, you’re handsome?
‘Thought he’d be at home with his inflatable girlfriend.
Come on then, let’s have a Valentine’s special.
Go sit down, we’ll get them in.
All on your own?
As long as it’s not a ‘loving cup’.
These are nice.
All Shirley’s idea.
It’s a good one.
About Ben ..
You’ve.
Not exactly.
I’m sorry.
I don’t.
Are you .. sure?
Come on, I’ve got a table booked for us.
Mmmmm..
‘Been a long time since we did this.
Too long.
Then .. we should make the most of it, don’t you think?
What the ...
These are good.
So Lydia’s busy tonight, is she?
Yeah.
I don’t get it - three beautiful women ..
I’ll be back in a minute.
Just put a sock in it, will you?
Charming.
Patrick and Yolande off out for supper, are they?
No. 
With Jay?
I told him to get lost for the evening.
You mean you just set him loose on the streets?
I gave him a tenner to amuse himself.
Doing what?
Playing gooseberry, that’s what!
Those cocktails any good?
Not my style, but my daughter likes them.
Your daughter?
I’ve heard that before but .. thanks.
You from round here?
On Valentine’s Night?
Fancy joining me?
‘Don’t think my bloke would like that much.
So where is he?
Away at the moment.
I don’t blame him.
‘You really believe that?
Kevin’ll be back alright.
I’m sorry, Bradley.
Yeah.
But maybe it’s all for the best.
You know, she always used to say .. it doesn’t matter what you do on Valentine’s Day.
I’m home.
Tan, it’s me.
Stacey, come on, I know you’re in.
What the hell is .. 
I came to give you something.
What is it?
Open the door.
Look Bradley, you can’t just ..
Alright.
What?
Lydia.
What?
I know it now, Stacey.
I can’t.
Why?
It’s ... just too late, Bradley.
No! No maybe you’re scared but .. you don’t mean that.
Bradley ...
If you didn’t, you would’ve found someone else by now.
Go home, Bradley.
