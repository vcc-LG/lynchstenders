[PATRICK SMILES. [IN THE B/G SHOW MAX
HAS ENTERED WITH BRADLEY]]


Why don’t we all go to the Vic - let our
hair down? [SMILES]

PATRICK:  [ON THE SPOT] Actually she’s..
planning more on us staying at home. Bit
of ‘quality time’?

BERT:  Even better. Let me know what time
she’s cooking supper and I’ll bring a few
cans back.

Valentine’s Day either. [SMILES]

it’s..[ADMITTING] the girl.

MAX:  [TAKEN ABACK] What d’you..[mean]

BRADLEY:  [IN] Lydia’s just too full on -
never stops, like everything’s one big
campaign.

MAX:  [KNOWINGLY] I thought you wanted a
woman who knows where she’s going.

BRADLEY:  Well maybe I don’t. [ADMITTING]
Maybe the girl I really want has been here
in Walford all the time.

[ON MAX TAKING THIS IN]

MAX:  You..don’t mean Stacey.


[AS BRADLEY LOOKS SAYS IT ALL, MAX
COVERS HIS UNEASE]

Well..what’s brought this on? [FISHING]
You haven’t been seeing her, have you?

BRADLEY:  No. [QUICKLY] Well yeah we..did
have a drink together yesterday.
[ADMITTING] A few drinks actually.

[ON MAX]

But nothing happened. [PAUSE] She doesn’t
even know how I feel.

[ON MAX, SLIGHTLY RELIEVED]

MAX:  Maybe that makes two of you.

[BRADLEY LOOKS AT MAX]

So you went on the lash for ol’ time’s
sake. So what?

BRADLEY:  So I enjoyed it. I’d forgotten
what it’s like to be with her. [SMILES]
But  we had a laugh. [REALISING] And that’s
something I never get to do with Lydia.

MAX:  [PAUSE] Then maybe you’re right;
maybe Lydia’s not the right girl for you.
[ON BRADLEY’S HOPEFUL LOOK] ‘Doesn’t mean

Stacey is.

BRADLEY:  But..


MAX:  [IN] The grass is always greener,
Bradley. You’re looking back and you
should   be looking forward. If you don’t
want Lydia then go and play the field..

BRADLEY:  [CONFUSED] But..

MAX:  [IN/QUICKLY] ‘You forgotten all the
grief you got with Stacey?

BRADLEY:  No but... maybe that wasn’t all
her fault. Look at the way we broke up..

MAX:  [IN] You’re feeling guilty.

BRADLEY:  [QUICKLY] Maybe.

[ON MAX FEELING THE SAME]

MAX:  Well we’ve.. all got stuff to feel
guilty about, son. But the important thing
is you learn from your mistakes and move
on. [PAUSE] One thing I know is you don’t
go out for hamburger when you’ve got steak
at home. [AS BRADLEY LOOKS QUICKLY AT MAX]

Lydia’s still a great girl.

BRADLEY:  I know but...[TORN]..I really
should be honest with her.

MAX:  On Valentine’s Day?

BRADLEY:  [CONFUSED] Yesterday you were
telling me it’s all a load of rubbish..

MAX:  [IN] Well I’m not your girlfriend,
am I? [PAUSE] All I’m saying is; it


wouldn’t hurt to give it a bit more time,
would it? If you still feel the same
then..let her down gently. [PAUSE] But
you..might give Stacey a wide berth too
or..     you could end up getting more
confused?

[A BEAT BETWEEN THEM BEFORE BRADLEY’S
WON ROUND]

BRADLEY:  Yeah. Yeah, maybe you’re right.

MAX:  [SMILES] You know I am, son.
